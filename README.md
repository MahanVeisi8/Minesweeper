# clui
simple cross-platform library for doing terminal things.

To learn more about functions, view `sample1.c` or `sample2.c`


## how to run 
1. install mingw/gcc on your system and add that to path
2. open a terminal and change directory to clui folder 
3. compile `c` code with `gcc sample1.c` or maybe you want to enable warning and debug mode: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -g sample1.c`
4. compile `cpp` code with `g++ your_code.cpp`

### library and sample codes are tested windows (mingw) and unix (gcc,clang) with both C & C++ codes.
